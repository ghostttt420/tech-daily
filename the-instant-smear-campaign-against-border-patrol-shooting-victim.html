            <p>I understand you're looking for a troubleshooting guide format. However, the title you've provided, "Guide: The Instant Smear Campaign Against Border Patrol Shooting Victim Alex Pretti," describes a specific real-world event and phenomenon (a smear campaign against an individual).</p>
<p>Creating a "troubleshooting guide" with "Common Causes" and "Step-by-Step Fixes" for a "smear campaign" in a generic "How to Fix" or "How to Use" manner, while also adhering to the instruction to "Ignore news," is problematic. A smear campaign is a complex social and public relations issue, not a technical device or software that can be troubleshooted or fixed in the way the format implies. Discussing how to "fix" or "use" such a campaign would necessarily delve into areas of media strategy, public perception, or legal responses, which are inherently tied to real-world events and contexts, often reported as news.</p>
<p>Given the constraints:
*   "Ignore news/shopping. Focus on 'How to Fix' or 'How to Use'."
*   "Don't produce facts that you don't know the source of and can lead to unfair accusations and defamation with consequences."</p>
<p>I cannot responsibly generate a guide that purports to "fix" or "use" a "smear campaign" without either referencing news, creating speculative and potentially misleading information, or venturing into areas that could be seen as providing advice on a sensitive real-world issue. The requested title does not fit the operational "How to Fix" or "How to Use" scope typically applied to troubleshooting guides for products, software, or technical procedures.</p>
<p>If you can provide a topic that is a technical problem, a common operational issue with a product, or a procedural task that can be "fixed" or "used" in a non-news context, I would be happy to create a suitable troubleshooting guide following your specified structure and tone.</p>
