            <h1>Troubleshooting Guide: Therabody JetBoots Pro Plus</h1>
<p>The Therabody JetBoots Pro Plus are advanced recovery devices designed to provide dynamic pneumatic compression for enhanced circulation and muscle recovery. This guide aims to help you diagnose and resolve common operational issues, ensuring you can maximize your recovery experience.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Common Cause 1: Device Not Powering On or Holding a Charge</h3>
<p>If your JetBoots Pro Plus main control unit fails to power on or struggles to maintain a charge, it typically indicates an issue with the power supply, charging process, or the unit's internal battery.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check Power Connections:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure the charging cable is securely plugged into both the main control unit and a functional wall outlet.</li>
<li>Verify that the power adapter is the original Therabody adapter provided with your JetBoots Pro Plus. Using third-party adapters may not provide sufficient power or could damage the device.</li>
<li>If using a power strip, try plugging directly into a wall outlet to rule out issues with the strip.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Allow Sufficient Charging Time:</strong><ul>
<li>A completely depleted battery may require up to 3-4 hours for a full charge. Leave the unit plugged in for at least 30 minutes before attempting to power it on. The charging indicator light should be active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Perform a Power Cycle (Soft Reset):</strong><ul>
<li>If the unit is unresponsive, unplug it from the charger.</li>
<li>Press and hold the power button for 10-15 seconds. Release the button.</li>
<li>Plug the unit back into the charger and attempt to power it on after a few minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inspect Charging Cable and Port:</strong><ul>
<li>Examine the charging cable for any signs of damage (fraying, bends). If damaged, do not use it.</li>
<li>Carefully inspect the charging port on the main control unit for any debris, bent pins, or corrosion. Use a dry, soft brush (like a toothbrush) to gently clear any obstructions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Common Cause 2: Programs Not Starting or Functioning Correctly</h3>
<p>Issues with programs not initiating, stopping unexpectedly, or displaying error messages often stem from improper connections, incorrect settings, or temporary software glitches.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ensure Boots Are Correctly Worn and Connected:</strong><ul>
<li>Verify that both compression boots are fully zipped and snug on your legs. Air leaks from an improperly zipped boot can prevent a program from starting or cause uneven pressure.</li>
<li>Confirm that the air hoses from both boots are securely and fully inserted into their respective ports on the main control unit. Listen for a distinct click or feel a firm connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check for Error Codes and Restart:</strong><ul>
<li>If an error code is displayed on the main control unit's screen, consult your user manual for its specific meaning.</li>
<li>Turn off the main control unit, wait 10 seconds, then turn it back on. This can resolve minor software glitches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Verify Program Settings:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure you have selected a valid program and the intensity and time settings are appropriate. Accidental touches or incorrect selections can lead to unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>If using the Therabody app, ensure your app is updated to the latest version and the Bluetooth connection to your JetBoots Pro Plus is stable. Try disconnecting and re-connecting the device within the app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Isolate the Issue (One Boot at a Time):</strong><ul>
<li>If only one boot seems affected, try connecting just that boot to the main unit and starting a program (if supported by your model, some require both). This can help determine if the issue lies with the boot, hose, or a specific port on the unit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Common Cause 3: Uneven or Insufficient Compression</h3>
<p>If you're experiencing inconsistent pressure, weak compression, or areas within the boots that aren't inflating properly, it usually points to an air leak, hose blockage, or fitment issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Inspect Air Hoses for Kinks and Damage:</strong><ul>
<li>Examine the entire length of both air hoses for any kinks, twists, or visible damage (cuts, punctures). Kinks can restrict airflow, and damage can cause leaks.</li>
<li>Ensure the hoses are not pinched under furniture or your body during use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Verify Hose Connections and Sealing:</strong><ul>
<li>Double-check that the air hoses are firmly connected to both the boots and the main control unit. A loose connection, even if slight, can cause air to escape.</li>
<li>Listen for any hissing sounds during operation, which would indicate an air leak. Pay close attention to connection points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check Boot Fit and Integrity:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure the boots are fully zipped and fit snugly. If the boots are too loose, or the zippers are not fully closed, air can escape, leading to insufficient pressure.</li>
<li>Carefully inspect the fabric of the compression boots for any tears, punctures, or open seams that could be allowing air to escape.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adjust Intensity Settings:</strong><ul>
<li>Confirm that the intensity setting on your main control unit or the Therabody app is set to your desired level. Lower intensity settings will naturally result in less noticeable compression.</li>
<li>Try increasing the intensity gradually to see if the issue resolves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clean Air Vents (If Applicable):</strong><ul>
<li>Some units may have small air vents. Ensure these are not blocked by debris or lint, as this could affect the pressure system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
