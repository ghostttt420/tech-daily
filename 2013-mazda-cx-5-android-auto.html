            # 2013 Mazda Cx 5 Android Auto<br><br>The 2013 Mazda CX-5 was a groundbreaking vehicle for its time, introducing Mazda's Skyactiv technology and KODO design language. However, as with many cars from a decade ago, its in-car technology suite lacks the modern conveniences we've come to expect, most notably smartphone integration like Android Auto. If you own a 2013 CX-5 and crave the safety and functionality of Android Auto, you're not alone. While Mazda didn't offer an official upgrade path, integrating Android Auto into your older CX-5 is entirely possible with aftermarket solutions.<br><br><h2> The Challenge: No Native Support<br><br>The primary hurdle is that the original head unit in a 2013 Mazda CX-5 predates Android Auto technology. It doesn't have the necessary hardware or software to run it, meaning a simple software update isn't an option. To get Android Auto, you'll need to replace or supplement the factory system.<br><br><h2> Solutions for Integrating Android Auto<br><br>There are generally two main approaches to bringing Android Auto into your 2013 CX-5:<br><br><h2># 1. Aftermarket Head Unit Replacement<br><br>This is often the most comprehensive solution, replacing your entire factory stereo with a modern, double-DIN unit that supports Android Auto directly.<br><br>-   **Pros:**<br>    -   Seamless integration with a factory-like look.<br>    -   Typically offers a larger, higher-resolution touchscreen.<br>    -   Often includes other modern features like improved Bluetooth, USB connectivity, and better audio processing.<br>    -   Can integrate with existing steering wheel controls (with an adapter).<br>    -   Many units are compatible with aftermarket backup cameras, or can integrate with your existing one.<br>-   **Cons:**<br>    -   Higher cost for the unit itself and potentially for professional installation.<br>    -   Requires specific wiring harnesses and a dash kit to fit the new unit into the CX-5's dashboard.<br>    -   May require an adapter (like an iDatalink Maestro) to retain steering wheel controls and other OEM features.<br>    -   Installation can be complex for DIYers.<br><br>-   **What to Look For:**<br>    -   **Double-DIN Compatibility:** Ensure the unit is the correct size.<br>    -   **Wired/Wireless Android Auto:** Decide if you prefer a wired USB connection or the convenience of wireless Android Auto.<br>    -   **Steering Wheel Control Adapter:** Verify compatibility with your CX-5's steering wheel controls.<br>    -   **Backup Camera Input:** Essential if you have or plan to add a reverse camera.<br><br><h2># 2. Portable/Standalone Android Auto Displays<br><br>These units are external screens that sit on your dashboard or attach to your windshield, connecting to your phone and outputting audio to your car's stereo.<br><br>-   **Pros:**<br>    -   Significantly easier and quicker to install; often plug-and-play.<br>    -   More affordable than a full head unit replacement.<br>    -   Can be moved between vehicles.<br>    -   No permanent modifications to your car's interior.<br>-   **Cons:**<br>    -   Less integrated look; it's an add-on device on your dash.<br>    -   Requires managing power cables and potentially audio cables.<br>    -   Audio output often relies on FM transmission or AUX input, which can be less robust than a direct connection.<br>    -   May obscure part of your windshield or dash depending on mounting.<br><br>-   **What to Look For:**<br>    -   **Screen Size and Quality:** Ensure it's large enough to be easily viewable but doesn't obstruct vision.<br>    -   **Mounting Options:** Consider how it will securely attach to your dashboard or windshield.<br>    -   **Audio Output:** Look for AUX out if your CX-5 has an AUX input, as it offers better quality than an FM transmitter.<br>    -   **Power Source:** Most use a 12V cigarette lighter adapter.<br><br><h2> Key Considerations for Installation<br><br>Regardless of the option you choose, keep these points in mind:<br><br>-   **Steering Wheel Controls:** If you opt for a head unit, you'll almost certainly need an interface module (e.g., Axxess ASWC-1, iDatalink Maestro) to retain these crucial controls.<br>-   **Backup Camera:** If your CX-5 has a factory backup camera, research if the new head unit or display can integrate with it, or plan to install a new aftermarket camera.<br>-   **Audio Integration:** For head units, this is direct. For portable units, plan for AUX input or a good quality FM transmitter.<br>-   **Professional vs. DIY:** Head unit replacement can be complex. If you're not comfortable with automotive wiring, consider professional installation. Portable units are usually DIY-friendly.<br><br>Upgrading your 2013 Mazda CX-5 with Android Auto can significantly enhance your driving experience, bringing modern navigation, communication, and entertainment safely to your fingertips. Research thoroughly, choose the solution that best fits your budget and technical comfort level, and enjoy the ride!
