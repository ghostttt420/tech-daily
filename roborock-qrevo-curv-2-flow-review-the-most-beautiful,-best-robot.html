            <h1>Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow Troubleshooting Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide is designed to help you diagnose and resolve common operational issues with your Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow robot vacuum. By following these steps, you can troubleshoot problems related to charging, cleaning performance, and navigation, ensuring your device operates smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<h2>Common Causes &amp; Solutions</h2>
<h3>1. Device Not Charging or Not Turning On</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> The vacuum may not be receiving power due to improper docking, a dirty charging base, or a power supply issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check Docking Station Connection:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure the charging dock's power cable is securely plugged into both the dock and a working wall outlet.</li>
<li>Verify that the dock's power indicator light (if available) is illuminated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clean Charging Contacts:</strong><ul>
<li>Turn off the robot vacuum.</li>
<li>Use a dry cloth to gently wipe the metal charging contacts on the underside of the robot and on the charging dock. Dust and debris can interfere with the electrical connection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reseat the Robot:</strong><ul>
<li>Manually place the robot onto the charging dock, ensuring the charging contacts align properly. Listen for a confirmation sound or observe the charging indicator on the robot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Perform a Hard Reset:</strong><ul>
<li>Locate the reset button (usually a small pinhole next to the power button or under a cover).</li>
<li>Use a paperclip or sim ejector tool to press and hold the reset button for 3-5 seconds.</li>
<li>Attempt to power on the robot or place it back on the charging dock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Test Power Outlet:</strong><ul>
<li>Plug another small appliance into the wall outlet to confirm it is functioning correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>2. Poor Cleaning Performance or Debris Left Behind</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Reduced suction, clogged components, or worn-out parts can lead to inadequate cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Empty Dustbin and Clean Filter:</strong><ul>
<li>Remove the dustbin and empty all collected debris.</li>
<li>Tap or brush clean the HEPA filter. For washable filters, rinse with water and ensure it is <em>completely dry</em> before reinserting (allow 24 hours).</li>
<li>Check for any blockages at the dustbin inlet port.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clean Brushes:</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Main Brush:</strong> Turn the robot over. Remove the main brush cover and take out the brush. Use the included cleaning tool or scissors to remove tangled hair, string, or fibers.</li>
<li><strong>Side Brush:</strong> Check the side brush for tangled hair or debris. If damaged or excessively worn, consider replacing it. Ensure it rotates freely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check for Suction Port Blockages:</strong><ul>
<li>With the dustbin removed, inspect the suction port and internal air ducts for any obstructions (e.g., small toys, large debris). Gently remove any blockages.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Verify Cleaning Mode:</strong><ul>
<li>Ensure the robot is operating in an appropriate suction mode (e.g., Max, Turbo) for the type of debris and surface being cleaned via the Roborock app.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. Navigation Issues or Getting Stuck Frequently</h3>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong> Dirty sensors, physical obstructions, or an outdated map can cause the robot to navigate inefficiently or get trapped.</p>
<p><strong>Step-by-Step Fix:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clean Sensors:</strong><ul>
<li>Turn off the robot.</li>
<li>Use a clean, dry cloth to gently wipe all sensors:<ul>
<li><strong>Cliff Sensors:</strong> Located on the underside of the robot (usually 3-4 sensors).</li>
<li><strong>Wall Sensors:</strong> Located on the side of the robot (often a clear window).</li>
<li><strong>LDS (Laser Distance Sensor):</strong> The rotating turret on top of the robot. Ensure it can spin freely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clear Obstacles in Cleaning Area:</strong><ul>
<li>Remove loose cables, small rugs, clothes, or other items that the robot could get tangled in or trapped under.</li>
<li>Ensure there's adequate clearance around furniture for the robot to maneuver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Check and Reset Map (via Roborock App):</strong><ul>
<li>Open the Roborock app and verify that the map is accurate and complete.</li>
<li>If the map appears corrupted or the robot is consistently getting lost, try resetting the map and allowing the robot to create a new one during its next cleaning cycle (ensure the charging dock is in its permanent location).</li>
<li>Define "No-Go Zones" or "Invisible Walls" in the app to prevent the robot from entering problematic areas.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Adequate Lighting:</strong><ul>
<li>While modern robots are good in low light, extremely dark conditions can sometimes affect navigation, especially for visual sensors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>By systematically working through these troubleshooting steps, you can resolve most common issues with your Roborock Qrevo Curv 2 Flow. Regular maintenance, such as emptying the dustbin and cleaning brushes and filters, will also significantly contribute to the longevity and performance of your robot vacuum.
